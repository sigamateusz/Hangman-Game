# Hangman-Game

Description

Create a script that has a list of European capitols, pick one of them randomly and let the user guess it. At the beginning program should represent each letter as a dash and display them at the screen. Additionally, program should show player's life points (let's say, 5).

Program should ask the user if he/she would like to guess a letter or whole word(s). Next, program waits for the user to enter letter or word. If entered letter doesn't exist in word or entered word is not correct - player will loose a life point. If this action brings player life to zero - the game is over!

If the player survives wrong letter guess - that letter should be added to "not-in-word" list and be displayed at the screen.

If the player guesses final letter or whole word(s) - he/she is the winner! And our world is safe ! :)
